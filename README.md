# Profit_Prediction_Startups


## Dataset:
The Dataset can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farhanmd29/50-startups.The data includes the R&D Spend,Administration Spend,Marketing Spend.Only 3 states are included in this one Florida,California and New York.

## Algorithm Used:
I have used the Linear Regression Algorithm for predicting the Startups Profit.It can also be done using other algorithms also but i preferred the 
Linear Regression one.


## Miscellaneous:
I know it is not that attractive but the main aim was to learn to use the ML and Flask part as it is just a casual attempt in html and css part using the Bootstrap but I will be improving it further as the time flies.
